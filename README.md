## Simple React App

Created a simple weather, calculator, and minesweeper app using React.  
Navigation is done using React Router through the navigation bar on the top of the page.

Weather app is used by typing in the name of the city in the search bar.  
Calculator app is a simple calculator that can do simple arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Minesweeper app is functional and will generate a board when a level is selected and tiles will be exposed if clicked on.

Social media login is a WIP.
